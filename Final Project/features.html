                    <p class="featureSynopsis">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (風の谷のナウシカ) is an animated post-apocalyptic fantasy adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki,
                         that premiered March 11, 1984. Isao Takahata produced the film for publisher Tokuma Shoten and advertising agency Hakuhodo, with TopCraft animating.
                          It was screened alongside two compilation movies for Sherlock Hound, The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle and Treasure Under the Sea. It is based on Miyazaki's manga of the same name,
                           first serialized on Animage magazine on February 4, 1982, and completed in March 1994. The story itself was inspired by the 1971 comic Rowlf by American cartoonist Richard Corben,
                            while the name Nausicaä was derived from the Greek epic Odysseus. Miyazaki was also strongly inspired by French comic artist Jean Giraud's Arzach (1975), as seen in the documentary,
                             Ghibli: The Miyazaki Temple. The movie has environmentalist undertones and was presented by the World Wide Fund for Nature when it was released in 1984 (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, 2022).

                    <p class="featureSynopsis">Castle in the Sky (天空の城ラピュタ , Tenkū no Shiro Rapyuta; also known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky) is a film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Tokuma Shoten.
                         It is the first film created by Studio Ghibli and released on August 2, 1986, although it is considered the second by some, as Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was created by the founding members two years prior.
                          During its theatrical release, it was screened alongside two compilation movies for Sherlock Hound, The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle, and Treasure Under the Sea. Miyazaki, who was forced to raise funds due to delays in the production of
                           Isao Takahata's film The Story of Yanagawa's Canals, proposed this film after consulting Toshio Suzuki, who worked for Tokuma Shoten. Additionally, this was the first film that featured the profile of Totoro in the opening,
                            despite being released before My Neighbor Totoro (1988) (Castle in the Sky, 2022).

                          She has since reconciled with Miyazaki. A more faithful live action film adaptation was released on March 1, 2014, featuring Kadono as the narrator. The film began production on April 1, 1988, and was released in Japan on July 29, 1989, and won the

                          who transfers to their high school from Tokyo. It was produced as part of the Japan Arts Council Grant Program and was an attempt by Studio Ghibli to allow their younger staff members to make a film reasonably cheaply following the release of Porco Rosso.
                           However, it ended up going both over budget and over schedule (Ocean Waves, 2022).

                    <p class="featureSynopsis">Pom Poko (平成狸合戦ぽんぽこ) is an animated comedy-drama film animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network and Hakuhodo. It was distributed by Toho and released on July 16, 1994.
                        This is the first feature film produced at Ghibli's new animation studio at Koganei, Tokyo, and is the first original work written and directed by Isao Takahata. The phrase Pom Poko in the title refers to the sound of bake-danuki drumming their own bellies as a form of tanuki-bayashi.
                         Specifically, the phrase started as a jocular explanation of meditative percussion at Shōjō-ji taken up in a 1919 poem by Ujō Noguchi, which became a popular nursery rhyme recorded in 1925. The film was first conceptualized by Ghibli co-founders Hayao Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki,
                          who later decided to hand the project to Isao Takahata. Takahata initially tried to adapt the 12th century war epic The Tale of the Heike (平家物語), but opted to instead write an original scenario using his co-founders' original story about raccoon dogs.
                           The story is set in Tama New Town where racoon dogs form a resistance against the encroaching humans. This was the first Ghibli film to use CG effects (Pom Poko, 2022).

                    <p class="featureSynopsis">Whisper of the Heart (耳をすませば) is an animated film directed by Yoshifumi Kondō and produced by Studio Ghibli and was released alongside On Your Mark on July 15, 1995. The film is based on the 1989 manga of the same name by
                         Aoi Hiiragi and published by Shueisha. The screenplay was written by Hayao Miyazaki. This is the first theatrical Studio Ghibli feature to be directed by someone other than Miyazaki or Takahata, and the only film to be directed by Yoshifumi Kondō, who died in 1998
                          of a ruptured aneurysm at age of 47. Studio Ghibli had hoped that Kondō would become the successor to Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. This was also the first collaboration with surrealist painter Naohisa Inoue. The poster's advertising slogan is "I have a favorite person." (好きなひとが、できました), coined by Shigesato Itoi.
                           The film's plot and setting deviate from the original manga, with the film being set in Tama City, Hino City and Musashino in Tokyo. In 2020, a live-action movie starring Nana Seino and Tori Matsuzaka was scheduled to be released on September 18, 2020, but was delayed for an undisclosed reason (Whisper of the Heart, 2022).

                          set in late Muromachi period of Japan, and centers on the struggle between the supernatural guardians of a forest and the humans who consume its resources, as seen by the outsider Ashitaka. Mononoke (物の怪) is not a name, but a general term in Japanese for a spirit or monster.
                           The advertising slogan used to promote the film is "Live" (Princess Mononoke), 2022).

                    <p class="featureInfo">1999, Directed by Isao Takahata</p>
                    <p class="featureSynopsis">My Neighbors the Yamadas (ホーホケキョとなりの山田くん) is a Studio Ghibli film written and directed by Isao Takahata. The film was released in Japan on July 17, 1999. The film is different than other Studio Ghibli films
                         due to its completion in watercolors, resulting in an "unfinished" appearance. The film does not possess one main storyline, but 8-15 minute "sketches." This film is about the daily lives of the Yamada family: Takashi and Matsuko (the father and mother),
                          Shige (Matsuko's mother), Noboru (aged approximately 13, the son), Nonoko (aged approximately 5, the daughter), and Pochi (the family dog). It has a significantly different "feel" to it than other Studio Ghibli films, not only because of its different style of animation,
                           but also because it is not a contiguous plot, but rather a series of vignettes, each preceded by a title such as "Father as Role Model", "A Family Torn Apart" or "Patriarchal Supremacy Restored" (My Neighbors the Yamadas, 2022).

                    <p class="featureSynopsis">Spirited Away (千と千尋の神隠し), is the 12th animated film written and directed Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli, and premiered in theaters in Japan on July 20, 2001. The story is about the adventures of a young ten-year-old girl
                         named Chihiro as she wanders into the world of the gods and spirits. She is forced to work at a bathhouse following her parents being turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba. The film was made to please the ten-year-old daughter of Hayao Miyazaki's personal friend, director Seiji Okuda.
                          Okuda's daughter even became the model for the film's protagonist, Chihiro. During the film's planning phase, Miyazaki gathered the daughters of Ghibli's staff in a mountain hut in Shinano Province to hold a training seminar.
                           His experience led him to wanting to make a film for them,
                           since he had never made a movie for girls at the age of 10 (Spirited Away, 2022).

                          The voice actor for the Baron was changed from Shigeru Tsuyuguchi to Yoshihiko Hakamada due to wanting to give the character a "youthful feeling" while Yoko Honna, who voiced Shizuku from Whisper of the Heart returns as Haru's classmate Chika. This is the only film so far to be directed by Hiroyuki Morita (The Cat Returns, 2022).

                    <p class="featureSynopsis">Howl's Moving Castle (ハウルの動く城) is the 14th animated fantasy film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, produced by Toshio Suzuki and animated by Studio Ghibli. It premiered at the Venice International Film Festival on September 5, 2004, and premiered in Toho cinemas in Japan on November 20, 2004.
                         It is based on the 1986 novel of the same name (translated in Japan as The Wizard's Howl and the Devil of Fire) by British writer Diana Wynne Jones and is about a young milliner named Sophie, who is transformed into an old woman by a witch, and the wizard Howl.
                          The first half of the film is relatively faithful to the original novel, but the second half was changed completely during development, adding themes of war not present in the source material. The original author, Diana Wynne Jones' only request was that Miyazaki "not change Howl's character".
                           She later gave a positive impression of the film, saying it retained the same spirit as her original work. Howl's Moving Castle had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on September 5, 2004, and was screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival on October 23, 2004.
                            It went on to gross ¥23.2 billion worldwide, making it one of the most financially successful Japanese films in history (Howl's Moving Castle, 2022).
