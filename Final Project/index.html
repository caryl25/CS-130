                <p>"Studio Ghibli (Japanese: 株式会社スタジオジブリ) is a Japanese animation film studio headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo.
                     It is best known for its animated feature films, and has also produced several short subjects, television commercials,
                      and two television films. Its mascot and most recognizable symbol is a character named Totoro, a giant catlike spirit
                       from the 1988 anime film My Neighbor Totoro. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are Spirited Away (2001),
                        Howl's Moving Castle (2004) and Ponyo (2008). The studio was founded on June 15, 1985, by directors Hayao Miyazaki
                         and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after the successful performance of Topcraft's Nausicaä of the
                          Valley of the Wind (1984). It has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.
                </p>
                <p>Five of the studio's films are among the ten highest-grossing anime feature films made in Japan. Spirited Away is second,
                     grossing 31.68 billion yen in Japan and over US$380 million worldwide; and Princess Mononoke is fourth,
                      grossing 20.18 billion yen. Many of their works have won the Animage Grand Prix award.
                       Four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. Five of their films have received
                        Academy Award nominations. Spirited Away won the 2002 Golden Bear and the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.
                         On August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production following Miyazaki's retirement. In February 2017,
                          Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film, How Do You Live?, which
                           he intended to be his last film.
                </p>
                <p>The name "Ghibli" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun ghibli (also used in English), based on the
                     Libyan Arabic name for hot desert wind (قبلي, 'ghiblī'), the idea being the studio would "blow a new wind through
                      the anime industry". It also refers to an Italian aircraft, the Caproni Ca.309. Although the Italian word would
                       be more accurately transliterated as "Giburi" (ギブリ), with a hard g sound, the studio is romanised in Japanese as Jiburi (ジブリ).
